## LT2316 H20 Assignment A2 : Ner Classification

Name: Konstantinos Mavromatakis
## Notes on Part 1.

I decided to use an LSTM since it is always a good choice for sequential data and I have used it in a previous assignment. Also, I knew I did not want to use a RNN given the vanishing and exploding gradients. I used an embedding layer since in the first assignment my features were token ids and I represented them as word embeddings which I am planning to train on part 2. I used hidden layers too to improve my model's performance. My forward function returns the prediction along with the hidden state (h,c) made with the Linear layer .
